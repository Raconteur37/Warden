# Warden
This is a bot for the Renatus Network community discord server.
The purpose of the bot is to help manage and encourage activity in the Renatus discord server.
The bot includes mini games like Blackjack and Word Guess, in which you can bet gems to win. 
Gems can be used to convert to other currency inside the minecraft server, such as coins or XP.
The bot also includes a custom algorithm that manages messages sent in different channels and rewards a custom currency (gems) based off of activity. 
Almost all aspects of Warden use SQL lite and I've tried to optimize the bot as much as possible.
The algorithm however is cache based and only edits the database at the very end.
- Some code has been deleted for privacy and to keep some of my secrets ;)
